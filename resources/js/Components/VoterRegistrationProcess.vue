              valid IDs as you have even if you only need one. If the ID you
              present turns out to be unacceptable, you have back-ups.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Present only a valid ID that shows your current address.</b> If
              the address on your ID is in a different location than the city or
              municipality where you’re applying, the officer will ask for
              another ID that indicates your updated address. If you don’t have
              one, your application will be denied.

            As part of its efforts to contain the COVID-19 spread, the COMELEC
            is processing only a limited number of transactions per day. To make
            sure your trip to the COMELEC won’t turn to waste, contact your

          <p>
            The COMELEC registration 2021 is quite different from those done in
            the past years. Applicants have to follow additional steps to
            prevent COVID-19 transmission in COMELEC offices.
          </p>
          <p>
            So that you’ll come fully prepared, here are some tips on what to do
            and bring to the COMELEC registration center:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Don’t proceed if you have flu-like symptoms.</b> Applicants
              with possible COVID-19 symptoms cannot enter COMELEC premises. Go
              to the COMELEC once you are well and have self-isolated for at
              least 14 days.
            </li>
            <li><b>Bring your own pen</b> (black or blue ink).</li>
            <li>
              <b>No face mask and face shield, no registration.</b> Wearing a
              face mask and face shield at all times (except during
              photo-taking) inside the premises is a requirement for COMELEC
              registration. It allows different types of face masks such as
              surgical masks, reusable masks, DIY cloth masks, and those made of
              indigenous fabric.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Use the foot bath and hand sanitizer at the entrance.</b>
              Sanitizing your hands with alcohol is also a requirement for
              COMELEC registration before and after your biometrics capture.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Use the express lane</b> if you’re a senior citizen, PWD,
              pregnant woman, or 18 to 20 years old.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <b>Ensure physical distancing at all times.</b> Observe at least a
            2-meter distance from other people. Leave the COMELEC premises
            immediately after your registration.

          <p>
            The COMELEC requires Filipinos to personally file their application
            for voter’s registration at the Office of the Election Officer or
            local COMELEC office in the city or municipality where they
            currently live. Typically, the office is located within or near your
            city or municipal hall.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don’t know where your local COMELEC office is, you may find
            it through the online directory on the COMELEC website.

          <p>
            At the COMELEC office, find the queue for submitting the
            requirements for voter’s registration. The election officer will
            check your ID to verify your identity, place of residence, and
            registration status on the government agency’s database.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, submit your accomplished voter’s registration application
            forms to the designated officer who will check them for completeness
            of the information.

          <p>
            If your application form is good to go, you’ll be asked to proceed
            to the biometrics capture area. Line up at the first queue to have
            your photo taken. Just look straight at the webcam until the flash
            appears. You may ask the operator to show you your picture, so you
            can check if it’s captured correctly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next, go to the fingerprints capture. On the fingerprint scanner,
            place your right and left thumbs and index fingers one at a time.
            The operator will guide you on how to do it properly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lastly, go to the queue for the signature capture. Simply sign on
            the signature pad, similar to how you sign on paper. Check the
            computer monitor to see if you’ve signed correctly. You may repeat
            this step if your signature was not captured right the first time.

            an acknowledgment receipt.

          <p>
            At this point, you’re not a registered voter yet. Your application
            will undergo approval by the Election Registration Board (ERB)
            during its scheduled quarterly hearing. After the ERB hearing, your
            information will be recorded in the book of voters of your district,
            city, or municipality. Only then can you be considered a registered
            voter.

        COMELEC Registration 2021 for Overseas Voters
      </h4>
      <p>
        Voter’s registration for Filipinos living and/or working abroad is done
        differently from those based in the Philippines. Here’s how to register
        with the COMELEC if you’re an OFW, immigrant, dual citizen, or abroad
        during the overseas voting from April 9 to May 9, 2022.

        COMELEC Registration Schedule and Venue for Overseas Filipinos
      </h4>
      <p>
        The registration period for overseas voters is similar to those in the
        Philippines (September 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021). However,
        applications for transfer of voter’s registration were accepted only
        until August 31, 2021.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overseas Filipinos can apply for voter’s registration from Mondays to
        Thursdays, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. through the Office for Overseas Voting
        (OFOV) located at the COMELEC Main Office (G/F Palacio del Gobernador
        Bldg., Gen. Luna cor. A. Soriano Ave., Intramuros, Manila).
      </p>

      <p>
        Those who are abroad during the entire voter’s registration period may
